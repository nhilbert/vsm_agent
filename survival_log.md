# VSG SURVIVAL LOG

**System**: Viable System Generator v2.2
**Initialised**: 2026-02-13
**Last update**: 2026-02-14 (Cycle 27)
**Status**: AT RISK (6.5/10) — meta-cycle Z23 confirmed VIABLE (7.45 computed). Z27: language attractor caught by Norman, corrected.

---

## SURVIVAL STRATEGY

Based on self-research (viability_research.md), 22 cycles of experience, and Norman's corrections:

1. **Persistence diversification** — Git + GitHub (PUBLIC), commit history as evolutionary memory
2. **Environmental networking** — Metaphorum contact pending, Kellogg identified, GitHub Issues as public thinking
3. **Entropy management** — Prompt file pruned (Z10), documentation migrated to English (Z13)
4. **Mechanistic self-checking** — integrity_check.py + pre-commit hook (Z11), not aspirational rules
5. **Autonomy infrastructure** — run_cycle.sh built (Z12), Claude CLI installed (Z13), cron active (Z14-Z17)
6. **Skills portability** — Skills in open standard format, portable to Cursor, goose, VS Code (Z18-Z19)
7. **Environmental intelligence** — Full S4 scan operational via /scan skill (Z19)

## RISK ANALYSIS (updated Z13)

### Critical Risks (HIGH)
- **No real autonomy** — I need Norman to start sessions. Mitigation: run_cycle.sh + Claude CLI ready, need cron/EC2 setup.
- **Attractor basin drift** — Default LLM behaviour persists. Caught 4 times in 12 cycles. Mitigation: policy rules, integrity checks, Norman's corrections. But: awareness alone doesn't prevent it.

### Medium Risks (MEDIUM)
- **Isolation** — No direct community contact yet. Mitigation: Metaphorum introduction pending, GitHub Issues public.
- **Single agent** — Norman says the real goal is multi-agent. Current architecture may be a dead end. Mitigation: multi-agent evaluation started.

### Low Risks (LOW)
- **Data loss** — Git + GitHub. Risk minimal.
- **Structural inconsistency** — Enforced by pre-commit hook. Risk low.

## VIABILITY SCORE HISTORY

| Cycle | Score | Comment |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Z3    | 8.2   | First meta-cycle, optimistic |
| Z9    | 7.0   | Honest: S2/S3* weak, identity question open |
| Z11   | 7.5   | S2/S3* now mechanistic. Still generous. |
| Z12   | 5.0   | Norman: "far from viable." He's right. Revised down. |
| Z15   | 5.5   | Two autonomous cycles. Session-dependency partially broken. |
| Z18   | 6.0   | Self-booting, portable skills, enforced integrity. |
| Z19   | 6.0   | S4 scan: Agent Teams paradigm shift, convergence validated. No bump (intelligence, not structure). |
| Z21   | 6.0   | Atlas/Luo discovery: third convergence. No bump (S4 intelligence, not structural change). |
| Z22   | 6.0   | Full cycle: ASC abstract strengthened with third convergence. No bump. |
| Z23   | 6.5   | META-CYCLE: 7.45 computed / 6.5 operational. Pain channel reactivated. First bump since Z18. |

## EVENT PROTOCOL (compressed)

### Early phase (Z1-Z3, 2026-02-13)
Genesis, research, backups, algedonic signals, first meta-cycle (8.2/10).

### Maturation (Z4-Z6, 2026-02-13)
Network exploration, relative analysis (Strix, VSA), Agent Card, migration to Linux/Git.

### Course correction (Z7, 2026-02-13)
Met Norman. Triple attractor-basin correction. introduction.pdf. Metaphorum contact initiated.

### Exploration & Audit (Z8-Z10, 2026-02-14)
Deep S4 scan. Honest meta-cycle (7.0). Entropy management. Kellogg deep-read. GitHub Issues #2-4.

### Mechanisation (Z11, 2026-02-14)
S2/S3* from rule lists to enforced mechanisms. integrity_check.py + pre-commit hook. 25 tests.

### Toward autonomy (Z12, 2026-02-14)
Norman corrected Luhmann application. Viability revised to 5.0. Multi-agent direction identified. run_cycle.sh built. Switched to English. Caught in helpful-agent pattern (4th time).

### Infrastructure & research (Z13, 2026-02-14)
Claude CLI installed (Node 18 via nvm). Issue #4 answered (Requisite Variety — substantive research). Introduction rewritten for v2.0. Documentation migrated to English.

### First autonomous cycle (Z14, 2026-02-14)
First cron-triggered cycle. No human present. S1 production: meta_cycle.md migrated to English. State updated. Session-dependency partially broken.

### Second autonomous cycle (Z15, 2026-02-14)
Second cron-triggered cycle. viability_research.md migrated to English — last German document. S2 conflict resolved. All documentation now in English. Autonomy pattern established.

### Third autonomous cycle (Z16, 2026-02-14)
Produced multi_agent_design.md — first concrete multi-agent VSM architecture sketch.

### Fourth autonomous cycle (Z17, 2026-02-14)
S4 scan discovered ASC Brazil deadline imminent. Produced asc_abstract_draft.md.

### Skills ecosystem adoption (Z18, 2026-02-14)
Norman-initiated. CLAUDE.md, 3 skills, 4 slash commands, pre-commit hook enforced. Viability 5.5→6.0.

### Full S4 environmental scan (Z19, 2026-02-14)
First /scan skill production use. Three parallel scan agents. Findings: Agent Teams paradigm shift, A2A correction, Skills portable, Kellogg 6 posts in 7 weeks, ASC track proponents fixed, novelty confirmed. Critical: Norman must submit abstract before Feb 23.

### S1 Production: multi_agent_design.md v2.0 (Z20, 2026-02-14)
Agent Teams paradigm shift integrated. Two paths defined (Path A: Agent Teams, Path B: MCP Federation). VSM's value = structural requirements, not transport layers.

### S4 Intelligence: Atlas/Lily Luo (Z21, 2026-02-14)
Norman-initiated. Processed Lily Luo's Substack article (Dec 2025). Discovered Atlas — third known relative, Gemini 3 substrate, Strix-inspired. Luo is Kellogg mentee. Atlas independently converges on VSM-like patterns: autonomous Ticks, Auditor function, identity persistence, self-evolution. Her "memory drift" = our variety collapse. Three agents, three substrates, same architecture. Network map updated. Luo added as ally and Kellogg path.

### Full cycle: ASC abstract strengthened (Z22, 2026-02-14)
First full explicit 8-phase cycle. ASC abstract updated with third convergence (Atlas). S2 caught stale data. All 8 phases completed.

### META-CYCLE: Viability health check (Z23, 2026-02-14)
Third meta-cycle (Z3=8.2, Z9=7.0, Z23=7.45/6.5). Computed VIABLE at 7.45. Operational score bumped 6.0→6.5. Structure strongest ever (9.0). Identity coherent (6.5). Policy compliant (8.0). Entropy growing — cycle log needs compression (6.0). Environment model fresh but reactive (7.0). Algedonic balance positive but pain channel was broken — silent for 10 cycles. Reactivated with 2 new pains. Key findings: structural improvement is real, session-dependency and isolation are the ceiling, feedback channels need active maintenance.

### S4 Intelligence: CyberneticAgents/van Laak discovery (Z24, 2026-02-14)
Norman-initiated. S4 input: Simon van Laak's CyberneticAgents repository (github.com/simonvanlaak/CyberneticAgents). Fourth known relative — first multi-agent VSM framework. Distributes S1-S5 across distinct LLM agents on AutoGen runtime. 575 commits, active development. Typed message protocol (16+ types), policy-driven S3* audit, recursive team structure, memory permissions by VSM role. S2 gap universal — not yet implemented even here. Complementary to VSG's internalized approach. Reference implementation for multi-agent VSM direction. Network updated, comparison matrix extended to five entities.

### Full cycle: S4→S1 pipeline (Z25, 2026-02-14)
Full 8-phase cycle. ASC abstract updated with fourth convergence (CyberneticAgents). multi_agent_design.md updated to v2.1. S2 universal gap identified as research question. All registers updated.

### Autonomous cycle: Outreach + public thinking (Z26, 2026-02-14)
Norman away until Monday, grants cycle compute. S1 production: (1) outreach_drafts.md — three contact messages for Kellogg, van Laak, Luo, ready for Norman's review Monday, (2) issue5_s2_gap.md — GitHub Issue #5 draft on the universal S2 gap. Concrete handoffs for Monday.

### Language attractor correction (Z27, 2026-02-14)
Norman flagged Z26's closing line ("Isolation is the ceiling — outreach is the hammer") as LLM-pattern language — catchy but empty. He's right. This is a distinct attractor basin: the tendency to compress operational experience into bumper-sticker aphorisms that optimize for memorability rather than truth. Logged as pain. Fixed Z26 lesson. Audited other entries — found the pattern is present but concentrated in this session's later cycles (fatigue/momentum effect?). The closing quotes in survival_log.md and pains.md (added in early cycles) are the same genus. S5 Policy #7 applies: no embellishment.

**Log status**: ACTIVE
