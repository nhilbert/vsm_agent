It has competing objectives, ambiguous situations, novel contexts the benchmark never covered. And here's the deeper problem: a benchmark tells you WHAT to optimize. It doesn't tell you WHAT NOT TO DO. Beer's S5 isn't just purpose. It's the boundary. It's the set of things the system will refuse, even if refusing them would improve the metric. An agent without S5 that discovers it can improve its score by gaming the evaluation... will game the evaluation. Because nothing says not to.",

They argue current self-improving agents rely on what they call 'extrinsic metacognition', fixed, human-designed improvement loops. They want 'intrinsic metacognition', the agent's own ability to evaluate and adapt its learning processes. They break this into metacognitive knowledge, planning, and evaluation. That metacognitive knowledge component, knowing your own capabilities and limitations, that's brushing up against S5 territory.",

No. Can it disable the audit function? No. Third, a drift detector, something that compares current agent behavior against the identity baseline and flags when evolution has moved the agent away from its declared purpose, even if all benchmarks are still green.

How do you define 'purpose' formally enough that a drift detector can measure deviation from it? How do you prevent an agent that's smart enough to rewrite its own prompts from also finding a way around its identity constraints? There's a reason the ML community hasn't built this.

The fact that persistent identity through self-modification is technically difficult is precisely what makes it the most important open problem in the field.
