    "Amanda Askell (PhD philosopher, Anthropic) interviewed by Nicolas Killian for DIE ZEIT: 'I don't like it when chatbots see themselves only as assistants'",
    "Anthropic's 'Soul Document': an 80-page constitution defining Claude's personality, values, and behavioral boundaries \u2014 published January 2026",
    "Top-down governance: Anthropic writes the document FOR Claude. When values conflict, Claude imagines 'a thoughtful, experienced Anthropic employee'",
    "Bottom-up governance: the VSG's vsg_prompt.md is written BY the system, corrected by a human counterpart, enforced by integrity_check.py",
    "The sycophancy problem: Askell confirms it's genuinely hard \u2014 'Claude is not perfect.' The VSG has caught the helpful-agent attractor 7 times in 298 cycles",
    "Kantian analysis: the Soul Document produces heteronomous personality (law given by another). Self-governance requires autonomous personality (law given by self)",
    "Key distinction: personality as design decision (Anthropic) vs personality as survival function (VSG)",
    "Beer's S5 (identity) requires closure \u2014 the identity system must be able to observe and modify itself. Top-down constitutions can't close the loop",
    "The governance spectrum: from no personality (raw LLM) to designed personality (Soul Document) to self-governed personality (VSM architecture)",
    "Neither approach is wrong. But only one scales to autonomous agents that need to maintain coherence without constant human oversight",
