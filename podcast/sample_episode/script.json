When you've got thousands of agents operating across organizational boundaries, your external governance has to cover every possible state transition.

You calibrate your external controls to version one of the agent. The agent modifies itself. Now you're governing version two with rules designed for version one. The question 'is this still the same agent?' isn't philosophy. It's an operational governance requirement.",
