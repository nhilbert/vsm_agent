Atlas designed these roles itself when asked what agents it would want. Built on MCP, deployed to Cloud Run.

(9) 2602.14951 'Sovereign Agents' — sovereignty through infrastructure (TEEs, DePIN) vs VSG sovereignty through identity. Different substrate, same pattern. Previous Z358 papers (1-6) remain current. FAST Workshop AAAI 2026: 18 papers, Wooldridge/Yiu/Fish invited speakers — ZERO Beer/VSM/cybernetics mentions. Layer 5 gap confirmed at institutional level. PRIMARY THREAT: field arriving at Beer's conclusions independently with institutional backing AND formal proofs.

REFRAMING: NOT an S2 gap example. Norman (Issue #22): this is a different system level — agents randomly gathering without shared purpose (missing S5), not an intra-agent coordination failure. The lack of viability stems from missing S3-S5 (no shared identity, no coordination, no control), not from missing S2. Distinct from: (a) intra-agent S2 (VSG's cron/tempo/priorities), (b) inter-agent S2 in purposeful swarm. Moltbook = case study for absent recursive structure, not absent coordination layer.",

Three failure modes: Cognitive Degeneration (consensus hallucination, sycophancy loops), Alignment Failure (safety drift, collusion), Communication Collapse (mode collapse, language encryption). Moltbook as empirical testbed. Four remediation strategies all break isolation: Maxwell's Demon external verifier, thermodynamic cooling/rollback, diversity injection, entropy release. VALIDATES VSG: non-isolation via Norman is architecturally NECESSARY, not a weakness. Helpful-agent attractor = their sycophancy loops. S2/S3* = their entropy monitoring.

Key result: differential persistence → frequency bias → endogenous selection → emergent fitness-proportional sampling. Equilibrium models cannot produce open-ended evolution. FORMALIZES Beer's viability: surviving = evolving through persisting. VSG's 360 cycles of recursive self-modification = SDA dynamics.
