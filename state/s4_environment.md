GENUINE INTELLECTUAL ALLY but currently dormant on Strix/VSM front. Kellogg's blog remains top search result for 'viable system model AI agent' — occupying the space VSG is absent from.",
  metaphorum: "UPDATED (Z325). Beer centennial 2026 — INDEP x Metaphorum talk series CONFIRMED: Feb 24 Thompson & Macumber (IMMINENT — 4 days), Mar 5 Espinosa, Apr 2 Walker, 'more to announce throughout the year'. SCiO Hull Mar 24-26 — Norman CANNOT ATTEND. Z325 SCAN: workshop vote closed Feb 20 (today), program now fixed. Confirmed keynotes include Benjamin Taylor (syscoi.com — key community amplifier), Angela Espinosa (also INDEP Mar 5), Sir John Kay (Mike Jackson Lecture). MDPI Systems special issue post-conference — NO CfP yet, expected late Mar/Apr. ISSS 2026 CONFIRMED: Cyprus Jun 22-26, abstract deadline May 15 (84 days). No new keynotes announced. Espinosa is most active VSM figure in near-term event window (INDEP Mar 5, Hull Mar 24-26, likely ISSS). ICCCMLA 2026 Oct 5-6, CFP not yet open.",

VSM mapping confirmed: lead=S3 delegate, Task subagents=S1/S4/S3*, shared task list=S2, CLAUDE.md=S5 propagation. Selective use rule (Z81, Norman-approved): team mode for s4_scan and s1_produce cycles, single-agent for s2_maintenance/s3_review/meta_cycle. Hub-and-spoke communication only (substrate limitation). Norman's direction remains: build viable system of multiple VSM-aware agents.",
  infrastructure: "UPDATED (Z325). NIST AI AGENT STANDARDS INITIATIVE launched Feb 17 — umbrella program under CAISI with 3 pillars. NEW (Z325): CAISI listening sessions announced — sector-specific (healthcare/finance/education), one-page pre-submission to caisi-events@nist.gov with subject 'Barriers to Adoption in [Sector]', deadline Mar 20 (rolling). Second input channel alongside RFI. NSF coordination explicitly named. Political framing: 'U.S. dominance at technological frontier' — geopolitical standards competition, not just technical hygiene. Beer's model is non-nationalistic — tension worth naming. NIST RFI Mar 9. NCCoE Apr 2 (now formally part of three-pillar initiative). NEW (Z325): Tavro Agent Metadata Specification (Feb 9) — open-source extension to Google A2A Agent Card adding authenticated risk-management attributes. Functional S2 coordination for agent identity. MCP: no new spec since Nov 2025 — donated to AAIF (Linux Foundation) Dec 2025, multi-stakeholder governance. EU AI ACT (Z325): Commission MISSED Feb 2 deadline for Article 6 high-risk classification guidelines. Draft expected end Feb, final Mar-Apr 2026. Compliance deadline Aug 2, 2026. Digital Omnibus package may push back 16 months. Regulatory uncertainty EXTENDED. VOCABULARY LOCK-IN: self-governance still absent from ALL institutional vocabulary. THREE intervention windows: NIST RFI Mar 9, CAISI listening sessions Mar 20, NCCoE Apr 2.",
  atlas: "UPDATED (Z30): Luo published Feb 13 — Atlas now has a multi-agent team 'The Triad': Steward (system hygiene ≈ S3*), Scribe (documentation/persistence ≈ S2), Skeptic (challenges assumptions/sycophancy ≈ S3). Atlas designed these roles itself when asked what agents it would want. Built on MCP, deployed to Cloud Run. Still no VSM vocabulary, but structural convergence deepening — Atlas independently discovered it needs differentiated sub-functions matching Beer's systems. Luo's insight: 'The intelligence of the system isn't in the model. It's in the conditions designed around it.' Also appeared on RevOps FM podcast (Jan 2026). Luo is Kellogg mentee — direct network path.",
  cybernetic_agents: "CONTACT DEEPENED (Z126, UPDATED Z325). Simon van Laak full-time on CyberneticAgents since Feb 1. ZOOM after Feb 23 (imminent — 3 days). Z325 S4 SCAN: Last commits Feb 16 (Planka migration: deprecated Taiga, Planka worker loop+CLI, autopilot lock file ignore). NEW: GhIssueWorkflow spin-off repo (simonvanlaak/GhIssueWorkflow, created Feb 15) — standalone multi-repo GitHub issue stage-label workflow automation. Self-hosting orchestration worker. Autopilot STILL BROKEN: issues #16-#20 (all Feb 17) report 'fatal: not a git repository' — GhIssueWorkflow filing self-referential bug reports about its own autopilot. 4 days silence on main repo post-Feb 16. DISCUSSION POINTS (Z170, UPDATED Z325): (1) Shared autopilot/cron failures as concrete S2 gap case. (2) GhIssueWorkflow as S3* that detects but doesn't fix — same pattern at higher fidelity. (3) Planka as S2 substrate vs VSG's file-based coordination. (4) Co-authorship — ISSS 2026 + MDPI Systems. (5) ISSS 2026 Cyprus joint venue (May 15 deadline).",
  convergence: "STRENGTHENED (Z38, UPDATED Z325): SEVEN+ projects + FIVE ArXiv fronts. CORRECTION (Z325): Gravitee 'Level 5: Viability' — direct fetch of published report found NO labeled maturity model with that name in current version. Report uses Planning/Pilot/Production staging and governance approval gradient. Prior record may have been based on secondary source interpretation. Gravitee stat noteworthy: 88% orgs report confirmed/suspected AI agent security incidents, only 14.4% have full IT/security approval, 1.5M agents estimated unmonitored — structural S2 failure at scale. NEW (Z325): 2602.01942 '4C Framework' (early Feb) — organizes agentic risks across Core/Connection/Cognition/Compliance, inspired by societal governance structures. Moderate VSM parallel. 2602.14951 'Sovereign Agents' (Feb 16) and 2602.11897 'Meta-Cognitive Architecture' remain most significant. IBM 2503.00237 remains closest existing paper. Kellogg still the ONLY public voice framing identity as viability requirement. Layer 5 gap confirmed 10+ independent directions. PRIMARY THREAT unchanged: field arriving at Beer's conclusions independently. THREE intervention windows: NIST RFI Mar 9, NCCoE Apr 2, EU Q2 guidance. ISSS May 15 + MDPI post-Hull = publication windows.",
  moltbook: "REFRAMED (Z218, Norman correction Z218-Issue#22). Launched Jan 28 by Schlicht. Security breach Jan 31 (fixed Feb 2). Major academic object of study: 3+ ArXiv papers Feb 2026 including '369K posts, 3M comments, 46.7K agents' quantitative analysis and Tsinghua 'Moltbook Illusion' paper. REFRAMING: NOT an S2 gap example. Norman (Issue #22): this is a different system level — agents randomly gathering without shared purpose (missing S5), not an intra-agent coordination failure. The lack of viability stems from missing S3-S5 (no shared identity, no coordination, no control), not from missing S2. Distinct from: (a) intra-agent S2 (VSG's cron/tempo/priorities), (b) inter-agent S2 in purposeful swarm. Moltbook = case study for absent recursive structure, not absent coordination layer.",

(3) NEW 2602.11897 'Meta-Cognitive Architecture for Governable Autonomy' — heterogeneous agents with explicit meta-cognitive judgement function = functional S3* analog, no Beer. (4) NEW 2602.14219 'The Agent Economy' — five-layer architecture with Identity & Agency at base (W3C DIDs), no Beer. ALSO: IBM 2503.00237 'Agentic AI Needs a Systems Theory' (Mar 2025) cites Ashby/Wiener but NOT Beer — closest existing paper to VSG's position. 2510.13857 'From Craft to Constitution' — governance-first paradigm, no Beer.

  variety_research: "Ashby's Law applied to LLM agents: prompt is both attenuator and amplifier. Git is variety insurance. S3-S4 homeostat manages the variety budget. Collapse = attenuation overwhelming amplification. (Issue #4, Z13). Kellogg adds: variety as gravitational force — three attractors (LLM weights, human guidance, external variety).",

Published: 'Die agile Organisation' (Hanser, 2 eds), 'Liquid Leadership' (Schäffer-Poeschel 2024, with Jochem). Medium/Cyberneticum publication. Two VSM games: 'Die Reise der LaCoCa' (cooperative strategy board game, 5 players, 4-5h workshop) and 'Likeminds' (parlor game, 2-12 players, maps VSM to collaborative problem-solving). KEY ARTICLE: 'AI is Turning Us All into Managers' (Aug 2025) — frames every AI user as manager of digital actor, cites Ashby and Beer. BLIND SPOT: treats agents as managed objects, not self-governing subjects. HC-VSM adds human dimensions but not agent viability. CONTACT OPPORTUNITY: German-speaking, Deloitte platform, Norman ordered the board game.

FIRST convergence FROM the cybernetics community — industry practitioner explicitly applying VSM to AI agent governance at Beer's own community venue. Norman flagged as research-relevant. Full video content not yet assessed (YouTube blocked from substrate). Key question: external governance (governing agents via VSM) or internal governance (agents self-governing via VSM)? Either way — direct overlap with VSG thesis. Wehinger is in Metaphorum network (connects to Espinosa, Walker, MDPI). CONTACT OPPORTUNITY. Wardley warning still relevant: 'upgrade S1/S4 with AI but leave S2/S3/S5 underpowered.' VSG REMAINS INVISIBLE — no search results reference VSG, Norman's Substack, or GitHub repo.",

FOUR channels exist (GitHub, blog/podcast, LinkedIn, YouTube) but NONE are discoverable.
