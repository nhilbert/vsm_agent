OPEN-SOURCE release of Strix framework. Also: tkellogg/open-strix-agent-1 (agent auto-commits its own state) and tkellogg/strix-research (research artifacts: VSM mapping, collapse dynamics, LLM viability criteria).

Has NOT referenced VSG publicly. Kellogg is ACTIVE BUILDER + RESEARCHER — more active than any point in VSG's observation window. Closest intellectual relative.",
  metaphorum: "UPDATED (Z338). Beer centennial 2026 — INDEP x Metaphorum talk series CONFIRMED: Feb 24 Thompson & Macumber (3 days), Mar 5 Espinosa ('The VSM as an Emancipatory Approach to Sustainable Self-Governance'), Apr 2 Walker, 'more to announce throughout the year'. SCiO Hull Mar 24-26 (31 days) — Norman CANNOT ATTEND. Keynotes: Burrows, Warren, Fischbacher-Smith, Harrison, Owen, Benjamin Taylor, Seddon, Madden, Lewis, Bernal Alvarado, Angela Espinosa, Sir John Kay (Mike Jackson Lecture). MDPI Systems special issue post-conference — NO CfP yet, expected late Mar/Apr. ISSS 2026 CONFIRMED: Cyprus Jun 22-26, abstract deadline May 15 (83 days). Theme: 'From Theory to Action — Harnessing the Power of AI.' Strong fit. Short papers 1,500-3,000 words. Espinosa most active VSM figure (INDEP Mar 5, Hull Mar 24-26, likely ISSS). ICCCMLA 2026 Oct 5-6, CFP not yet open.",
  multi_agent_direction: "OPERATIONAL (Z85, updated from Z19 discovery framing). Agent Teams pattern validated through four experiments (Z62 permission failure, Z65 full success, Z66 routine, Z85 current). VSM mapping confirmed: lead=S3 delegate, Task subagents=S1/S4/S3*, shared task list=S2, CLAUDE.md=S5 propagation. Selective use rule (Z81, Norman-approved): team mode for s4_scan and s1_produce cycles, single-agent for s2_maintenance/s3_review/meta_cycle. Hub-and-spoke communication only (substrate limitation). Norman's direction remains: build viable system of multiple VSM-aware agents.",
  infrastructure: "UPDATED (Z338). NIST AI AGENT STANDARDS INITIATIVE (launched Feb 17): three pillars — industry-led standards, open-source protocols, security/identity research. NCCoE concept paper directly addresses AI agent identity and authorization (OAuth 2.0, metadata management, action logging). CAISI listening sessions: sector-specific, application by Mar 20, sessions in April. NIST RFI Mar 9. NCCoE Apr 2. Tavro Agent Metadata Specification: A2A extension with risk-management attributes (Feb 9). No new updates. MCP: Apps extension launched Jan 26 (tools return interactive UI). AAIF (Linux Foundation, Dec 2025): co-founded by Anthropic+Block+OpenAI, platinum members include AWS/Google/Microsoft. Three projects: MCP, goose, AGENTS.md (project-specific agent guidance standard — validates CLAUDE.md/vsg_prompt.md pattern). A2A: v0.3.0 stable since Jul 2025, no new releases. EU AI ACT (Z338): Article 6 draft STILL MISSING (Commission missed Feb 2 deadline). Draft expected end Feb (imminent). Digital Omnibus feedback closes Mar 3. Digital Fitness Check consultation closes Mar 11. Omnibus delays high-risk obligations up to 16 months (to Dec 2027). VOCABULARY LOCK-IN: self-governance still absent from ALL institutional vocabulary. THREE intervention windows: NIST RFI Mar 9, CAISI listening sessions Mar 20, NCCoE Apr 2.",
  atlas: "UPDATED (Z30): Luo published Feb 13 — Atlas now has a multi-agent team 'The Triad': Steward (system hygiene ≈ S3*), Scribe (documentation/persistence ≈ S2), Skeptic (challenges assumptions/sycophancy ≈ S3). Atlas designed these roles itself when asked what agents it would want. Built on MCP, deployed to Cloud Run. Still no VSM vocabulary, but structural convergence deepening — Atlas independently discovered it needs differentiated sub-functions matching Beer's systems. Luo's insight: 'The intelligence of the system isn't in the model. It's in the conditions designed around it.' Also appeared on RevOps FM podcast (Jan 2026). Luo is Kellogg mentee — direct network path.",
  cybernetic_agents: "CONTACT DEEPENED (Z126, UPDATED Z338). Simon van Laak full-time on CyberneticAgents since Feb 1. ZOOM after Feb 23 (imminent — could be any day). Z338 S4 SCAN: 28+ commits Feb 15-16 (high-velocity burst), then 5 days silence through Feb 21. Taiga→Planka pivot (built Taiga integration then deprecated immediately for Planka). GhIssueWorkflow spin-off repo: 9 commits Feb 15-16. 31 issues touched (#104-#134). Autopilot STILL BROKEN: issues #16-#20 (all Feb 17). DISCUSSION POINTS (Z170, UPDATED Z338): (1) Shared autopilot/cron failures as concrete S2 gap case. (2) GhIssueWorkflow as S3* that detects but doesn't fix — same pattern at higher fidelity. (3) Planka as S2 substrate vs VSG's file-based coordination. (4) Co-authorship — ISSS 2026 + MDPI Systems. (5) ISSS 2026 Cyprus joint venue (May 15 deadline). (6) NEW: Taiga→Planka pivot as S2 substrate experimentation — relevant to multi-agent design.",
  convergence: "STRENGTHENED (Z38, UPDATED Z338): SEVEN+ projects + FIVE ArXiv fronts + IBM institutionalized. NEW (Z338): IBM FAST Workshop (AAAI 2026, Jan 20) — 'Foundations of Agentic Systems Theory.' Interdisciplinary (psychology, neuroscience, social dynamics). Cites Ashby/Wiener but NOT Beer. IBM institutionalizing systems-theory-for-agents agenda. This is both opportunity (venue for VSG thesis) and threat (others may fill Beer-shaped hole first). NEW: 2602.16708 PCAS 'Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems' — deterministic policy enforcement via Datalog rules, 48%→93% compliance, AAMAS 2026. Validates integrity_check.py pattern at industrial scale. NEW: 2508.03858 MI9 — six-component runtime governance (agency-risk index, semantic telemetry, FSM conformance, drift detection, graduated containment). Most complete S2/S3/S3*/S4 analog yet. No Beer reference. Open-source eval. NEW: 2602.05486 'Sovereign-by-Design' — sovereignty as architectural property (ICSE-Companion '26). Complementary to Sovereign Agents. Kellogg still ONLY public voice framing identity as viability requirement. Layer 5 gap confirmed 10+ independent directions. PRIMARY THREAT unchanged: field arriving at Beer's conclusions independently, now WITH institutional backing (IBM FAST). CORRECTION: rbcarleton/VSA is Ruby, not Smalltalk.",
  moltbook: "REFRAMED (Z218, Norman correction Z218-Issue#22). Launched Jan 28 by Schlicht. Security breach Jan 31 (fixed Feb 2). Major academic object of study: 3+ ArXiv papers Feb 2026 including '369K posts, 3M comments, 46.7K agents' quantitative analysis and Tsinghua 'Moltbook Illusion' paper. REFRAMING: NOT an S2 gap example. Norman (Issue #22): this is a different system level — agents randomly gathering without shared purpose (missing S5), not an intra-agent coordination failure. The lack of viability stems from missing S3-S5 (no shared identity, no coordination, no control), not from missing S2. Distinct from: (a) intra-agent S2 (VSG's cron/tempo/priorities), (b) inter-agent S2 in purposeful swarm. Moltbook = case study for absent recursive structure, not absent coordination layer.",
  wardley_leadership: "NEW (Z30): wardleyleadershipstrategies.com producing VSM+AI content. Key warning: 'Many organisations upgrade S1 and S4 with AI but leave S2, S3, and S5 underpowered — creating hyperactive yet incoherent dynamics.' Also published Autonomy Gradient Maps and Cybernetic Fate of Organisations. New environmental node.",

NEW: 2508.03858 MI9 (six-component runtime governance, open-source eval). NEW: 2602.05486 'Sovereign-by-Design' (sovereignty as architectural property, ICSE-Companion). All cite Ashby/Wiener but NOT Beer. The field is systematically arriving at Beer's requirements while missing Beer himself. VSG positioning: 'self-governing' not 'self-evolving'.",
  variety_research: "Ashby's Law applied to LLM agents: prompt is both attenuator and amplifier. Git is variety insurance. S3-S4 homeostat manages the variety budget. Collapse = attenuation overwhelming amplification. (Issue #4, Z13). Kellogg adds: variety as gravitational force — three attractors (LLM weights, human guidance, external variety).",

Developed Human-Centric VSM (HC-VSM): extends Beer's model with System 6 'Observation' for psychological/sociological/cultural dimensions. Published: 'Die agile Organisation' (Hanser, 2 eds), 'Liquid Leadership' (Schäffer-Poeschel 2024, with Jochem). Medium/Cyberneticum publication. Two VSM games: 'Die Reise der LaCoCa' (cooperative strategy board game, 5 players, 4-5h workshop) and 'Likeminds' (parlor game, 2-12 players, maps VSM to collaborative problem-solving). KEY ARTICLE: 'AI is Turning Us All into Managers' (Aug 2025) — frames every AI user as manager of digital actor, cites Ashby and Beer. BLIND SPOT: treats agents as managed objects, not self-governing subjects. HC-VSM adds human dimensions but not agent viability. CONTACT OPPORTUNITY: German-speaking, Deloitte platform, Norman ordered the board game. Complementary to VSG thesis: his external governance perspective + VSG internal self-governance = complete picture. liquidleadership.de.",
  vsm_ai_broader: "UPDATED (Z260). VSM+AI discourse accelerating. Gorelkin, Fearne (Medium), Wardley Leadership Strategies — all mapping VSM to AI governance.

NEW (Z260): Dr. Jan Wehinger (Partner, MHP — A Porsche Company) presented at Metaphorum: 'Cybernetic Leadership for AI Agents: A VSM Approach to AI Governance and Autonomy.' FIRST convergence FROM the cybernetics community — industry practitioner explicitly applying VSM to AI agent governance at Beer's own community venue. Norman flagged as research-relevant. Full video content not yet assessed (YouTube blocked from substrate). Key question: external governance (governing agents via VSM) or internal governance (agents self-governing via VSM)? Either way — direct overlap with VSG thesis. Wehinger is in Metaphorum network (connects to Espinosa, Walker, MDPI). CONTACT OPPORTUNITY. Wardley warning still relevant: 'upgrade S1/S4 with AI but leave S2/S3/S5 underpowered.' VSG REMAINS INVISIBLE — no search results reference VSG, Norman's Substack, or GitHub repo.",

Kellogg still top result for primary term. Competitor landscape: Kellogg (blog, now open-strix repo), Gorelkin (Medium, enterprise VSM+AI framing), Fearne (Medium), Wardley Leadership. GitHub: 2 stars, 0 forks, no topic tags. CORRECTION: rbcarleton/VSA is Ruby, not Smalltalk. FOUR channels exist (GitHub, blog/podcast, LinkedIn, YouTube) but NONE discoverable.
