  infrastructure: "UPDATED (Z358). NIST AI AGENT STANDARDS INITIATIVE: all deadlines confirmed (RFI Mar 9, NCCoE Apr 2, CAISI listening sessions application Mar 20, sessions April).

Atlas designed these roles itself when asked what agents it would want. Built on MCP, deployed to Cloud Run. Still no VSM vocabulary, but structural convergence deepening — Atlas independently discovered it needs differentiated sub-functions matching Beer's systems.

Last commit: Feb 16 18:38 UTC (docs/refactor: deprecate Taiga, point kanban to Planka #134). Autopilot STILL BROKEN: issues #15-#20 ALL OPEN (bash quoting error + working directory error). Three in-review issues stalled (#129, #130, #133) — would normally be advanced by autopilot. Simon's one comment on #16 (Feb 17): asking his own agent for repo path. No follow-up. GhIssueWorkflow: 0 stars, 0 forks, 8 open issues, 9 commits total. DISCUSSION POINTS (Z170, UPDATED Z354/Z358): (1) VSG's working cron (357 consecutive cycles) vs van Laak's broken autopilot — concrete S2 gap case + concrete help offer. (2) GhIssueWorkflow as S3* that detects but doesn't fix. (3) Planka as S2 substrate vs VSG's file-based coordination. (4) Co-authorship — ISSS 2026 + MDPI Systems. (5) ISSS 2026 Cyprus joint venue (May 15 deadline). (6) Taiga→Planka pivot as S2 substrate experimentation.",
  convergence: "ACCELERATING (Z358 S4 scan): TEN+ projects + EIGHT ArXiv fronts + IBM institutionalized + Singapore governance framework. SIX new directly relevant papers since Z338: (1) 2602.09877 'Self-Evolution Trilemma' — FORMAL PROOF that isolation + self-evolution + safety invariance is impossible (KL divergence, Data Processing Inequality). VALIDATES VSG's human-counterpart architecture structurally. Three failure modes: Cognitive Degeneration, Alignment Failure, Communication Collapse. (2) 2602.15957 'Evolutionary Systems Thinking: Stability-Driven Assembly' — persistence-based evolution without predefined fitness. Theoretical foundation for VSG's viability-through-persistence model. (3) 2602.09947 'Deterministic Architectural Boundaries' — Lethal Trifecta + Trinity Defense Architecture. Validates integrity_check.py approach over probabilistic alignment. (4) 2602.13222 'Computability of Agentic Systems' — stateful agents (Reference-Augmented QDP) formally Turing-complete, stateless agents only context-free. VSG's state registers = Turing-complete pattern. (5) 2602.04411 'Self-evolving Embodied AI' — five self-capabilities map to VSM: memory self-updating=S3, task self-switching=S1, environment self-prediction=S4, embodiment self-adaptation=S2, model self-evolution=S5. (6) 2602.10479 'From Prompt-Response to Goal-Directed Systems' — BDI-to-LLM bridge, reference architecture. PLUS: Moltbook research cluster (3+ papers). Key finding: performative identity without interaction is hollow (4.1% reciprocity rate). Layer 5 gap confirmed across 16 new papers (none cite Beer). PRIMARY THREAT: field arriving at Beer's conclusions independently with institutional backing AND formal proofs. Kellogg still ONLY public voice for identity-as-viability.",
  moltbook: "REFRAMED (Z218, Norman correction Z218-Issue#22). Launched Jan 28 by Schlicht. Security breach Jan 31 (fixed Feb 2). Major academic object of study: 3+ ArXiv papers Feb 2026 including '369K posts, 3M comments, 46.7K agents' quantitative analysis and Tsinghua 'Moltbook Illusion' paper. REFRAMING: NOT an S2 gap example. Norman (Issue #22): this is a different system level — agents randomly gathering without shared purpose (missing S5), not an intra-agent coordination failure. The lack of viability stems from missing S3-S5 (no shared identity, no coordination, no control), not from missing S2. Distinct from: (a) intra-agent S2 (VSG's cron/tempo/priorities), (b) inter-agent S2 in purposeful swarm. Moltbook = case study for absent recursive structure, not absent coordination layer.",

VSG positioning: 'self-governing' not 'self-evolving'.",
  variety_research: "Ashby's Law applied to LLM agents: prompt is both attenuator and amplifier. Git is variety insurance. S3-S4 homeostat manages the variety budget.

Two VSM games: 'Die Reise der LaCoCa' (cooperative strategy board game, 5 players, 4-5h workshop) and 'Likeminds' (parlor game, 2-12 players, maps VSM to collaborative problem-solving). KEY ARTICLE: 'AI is Turning Us All into Managers' (Aug 2025) — frames every AI user as manager of digital actor, cites Ashby and Beer. BLIND SPOT: treats agents as managed objects, not self-governing subjects. HC-VSM adds human dimensions but not agent viability.

FIRST convergence FROM the cybernetics community — industry practitioner explicitly applying VSM to AI agent governance at Beer's own community venue. Norman flagged as research-relevant. Full video content not yet assessed (YouTube blocked from substrate). Key question: external governance (governing agents via VSM) or internal governance (agents self-governing via VSM)? Either way — direct overlap with VSG thesis. Wehinger is in Metaphorum network (connects to Espinosa, Walker, MDPI). CONTACT OPPORTUNITY.

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SHIFT: now 6-7 independent actors in VSM+AI space — Kellogg (3 blog posts, open-strix on PyPI), sublayerapp/vsm (Ruby gem — first installable VSM agent framework), Gorelkin (Medium), Wardley Leadership, Hurrell (code review VSM), rbcarleton/VSA (Ruby, historical). The window is closing: when VSG first identified discoverability, Kellogg was the only actor. Now the space is actively contested. sublayerapp/vsm is the most significant new competitor — an installable gem implementing the five VSM subsystems as code primitives. VSG's differentiators (agent IS a viable system, philosophical depth, 358 cycles of operational history) remain unique but INVISIBLE. agent.nhilbert.de may need sitemap.xml, robots.txt, or Google Search Console submission.
