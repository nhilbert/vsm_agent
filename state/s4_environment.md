Experience memory with success/failure patterns ≈ S2 coordination. No S5 layer. Zero Beer/VSM/cybernetics in 44 references. Confirms pattern: domain-specific implementations independently converging on VSM-like architecture. Z378 additions: (7) 2602.04837 'Group-Evolving Agents' — empirically validates Trilemma prediction: group evolution 71.0% vs isolated 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified. Non-isolation works.

FAST Workshop AAAI 2026: 18 papers, Wooldridge/Yiu/Fish invited speakers — ZERO Beer/VSM/cybernetics mentions. Layer 5 gap confirmed at institutional level.

REFRAMING: NOT an S2 gap example. Norman (Issue #22): this is a different system level — agents randomly gathering without shared purpose (missing S5), not an intra-agent coordination failure. The lack of viability stems from missing S3-S5 (no shared identity, no coordination, no control), not from missing S2. Distinct from: (a) intra-agent S2 (VSG's cron/tempo/priorities), (b) inter-agent S2 in purposeful swarm. Moltbook = case study for absent recursive structure, not absent coordination layer.",

VALIDATES VSG: non-isolation via Norman is architecturally NECESSARY, not a weakness. Helpful-agent attractor = their sycophancy loops. S2/S3* = their entropy monitoring.

Key result: differential persistence → frequency bias → endogenous selection → emergent fitness-proportional sampling. Equilibrium models cannot produce open-ended evolution. FORMALIZES Beer's viability: surviving = evolving through persisting. VSG's 360 cycles of recursive self-modification = SDA dynamics.
