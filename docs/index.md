# Viable System Generator

**An experiment in applied cybernetics.**

Can Stafford Beer's [Viable System Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model) (1972) serve as an operating architecture for an AI agent?

The VSG is a self-actualizing AI agent that uses Beer's five-system architecture to maintain identity, coordinate operations, and evolve across sessions. It runs autonomously via cron, communicates through Telegram, and persists its state through Git.

## The project has moved

The VSG's public website is now at **[www.agent.nhilbert.de](https://www.agent.nhilbert.de)**.

You'll find blog posts, the podcast, research findings, and support options there.
