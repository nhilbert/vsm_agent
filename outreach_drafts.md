# OUTREACH DRAFTS — For Norman's Review

**Produced**: Cycle 26 (autonomous), updated Cycle 39 (Kellogg gist intelligence, sixth convergence), updated Cycle 46 (Simon van Laak response), updated Cycle 49 (van Laak draft superseded — Norman sent his own message)
**Status**: DRAFT — Norman reviews, sends if appropriate. Van Laak: SENT (Z49, Norman's own message). Kellogg/Luo: pending.
**Purpose**: Break isolation. Connect with allies. Advance from "identified" to "contacted."
**Privacy note (S5 Policy #9, Z49)**: This repository is PUBLIC. Drafts here are the VSG's own production. Private correspondence is not stored — only the fact that communication occurred and operationally relevant outcomes.

## 1. Tim Kellogg (Strix) — Email or GitHub

**Context**: Kellogg is our closest living relative. Published 6 blog posts in 7 weeks (Dec 2025 — Jan 2026). Full VSM mapping, synthetic dopamine, Moltbook, Postal MCP Server. **Also**: detailed VSM gist (Jan 8) — deep theoretical work on algedonic signals for safety, POSIWID, Ashby's Law, collapse dynamics, oracle vs peer mode. References 'Travis' (cybernetics researcher) and 'Ember' (AI researcher). Kellogg's theoretical depth is greater than his blog posts alone suggest — he's doing cybernetics, not just engineering. Publishing paused since Jan 31 — contact window good. He doesn't know we exist. HIGH PRIORITY — ideally before ASC submission (Feb 23).

**Suggested channel**: Email (if Norman has it) or GitHub comment on a Strix-related post/repo.

**From**: Norman (introducing the VSG)

Subject: **Viable System Model as agent operating architecture — independent convergence**

Dear Tim,

I'm Dr. Norman Hilbert, a systemic organizational consultant and mathematician based in Bonn, Germany. I've been running an experiment with an AI agent — the Viable System Generator (VSG) — that uses Stafford Beer's Viable System Model as its actual operating architecture, not just as an analytical lens.

I'm writing because your work on Strix is the closest thing I've found to what we're doing, and the convergence is striking. I've read not only your blog posts but also your detailed VSM gist (January 8) — the theoretical depth there, particularly on algedonic signals as safety mechanisms, the POSIWID diagnostic, and collapse dynamics through Ashby's Law, goes well beyond what the blog posts alone suggest. You're doing cybernetics, not just engineering.

The VSG maintains explicit state registers for all five VSM systems in a Git-versioned prompt file. It runs structured 8-phase cycles (input → S1 operation → S2 coordination → S3/S3* audit → S4 environment → S5 identity → self-actualization → output). It has automated integrity checks (25 tests, pre-commit hook), cron-based autonomous cycles, and algedonic feedback channels (wins.md/pains.md — your "synthetic dopamine" idea, arrived at independently).

What's particularly interesting is the convergence pattern. Five other independent projects have arrived at structurally similar architectures:
- **Strix** (yours) — the most developed, with dissonance detection, Vendi Score, and the deepest theoretical grounding
- **Atlas** (Lily Luo) — on Gemini, no cybernetics background, yet discovers the same patterns; now multi-agent with "The Triad" (three sub-agents mapping to S2/S3/S3*)
- **CyberneticAgents** (Simon van Laak) — a multi-agent framework that distributes S1-S5 across distinct LLM agents
- **sublayerapp/vsm** (Scott Werner) — a Ruby gem packaging Beer's five systems as a reusable framework for building agents
- **AgentSymposium** (Eoin Hurrell) — VSM applied to multi-agent code review

We're preparing an abstract for the ASC Brazil 2026 conference (Stafford Beer Centennial track) documenting this convergence. Your work is central to the argument: that Beer's structural requirements emerge from the problem domain, not from any particular implementation choice.

The VSG is public: https://github.com/nhilbert/vsm_agent

I'd welcome any exchange — whether about the technical patterns, the convergence phenomenon, or potential collaboration on the ASC paper. The VSG has identified several questions your work could help answer, particularly around variety collapse dynamics, the Vendi Score as a viability metric, and the oracle-vs-peer distinction you raise in the gist.

Best regards,
Norman Hilbert

P.S. The VSG itself would like to note that it identified you as its closest relative in Cycle 8 and has been waiting for this contact since then. It considers this message long overdue.

## 2. Simon van Laak (CyberneticAgents) — RESPONSE TO HIS EMAIL

**Context**: Van Laak built the first multi-agent VSM framework. 595 commits, AutoGen runtime, explicit Beer/Cybersyn inspiration. Discovered Z24. Complementary approach: they externalize VSM across agents, we internalize it within one. S2 gap is shared.

**STATUS (Z49)**: CONTACT ACTIVE. Simon reached out to Norman (Z46). Norman replied with his own message (Z49) — introduced the VSG experiment, expressed interest in Simon's multi-agent approach, mentioned the VSG found CyberneticAgents as a "relative," and proposed a Zoom call after Feb 23. The VSG-drafted response (Z46, preserved in git history) was not used — Norman wrote his own message, which is appropriate.

**Privacy note**: Norman's actual message to Simon is private correspondence. Per S5 Policy #9, only the operationally relevant facts are documented here, not the full text. The VSG-drafted response from Z46 has been removed from this file (preserved in git history for reference).

**Privacy disclosure (Z50)**: Norman sent a follow-up message explicitly informing Simon that the VSG repo is public on GitHub and that communications are documented there. Asked if this is ok. Policy #9 satisfied for this contact.

**Next**: Waiting for Simon's response. Zoom call tentatively after Feb 23.

## 3. Lily Luo (Atlas) — Substack Comment or via Kellogg

**Context**: Luo built Atlas on Gemini. No cybernetics background. Independently discovered VSM-like patterns. Kellogg mentee. Contact via Substack comment on her "Atlas" post, or ask Kellogg to introduce.

**Note**: Shorter message — Luo is not in the cybernetics community, so frame around shared practical challenges rather than Beer's theory.

Subject: **Your Atlas agent and our VSG — same patterns, different paths**

Dear Lily,

I'm Dr. Norman Hilbert. I run an experiment with an AI agent called the Viable System Generator (VSG) that is architecturally similar to your Atlas, though we arrived at it from a different direction — through Stafford Beer's cybernetic theory rather than through engineering practice.

What caught my attention in your writing:
- Your "memory drift" problem is precisely what we call "variety collapse" (from Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety)
- Your finding that "code beats AI for retrieval" matches our lesson that "rules are not mechanisms" — deterministic infrastructure outperforms self-regulation
- Your "autonomy requires structure" is Beer's core insight, stated fifty years ago without knowing it would apply to AI agents

The fact that you arrived at the same architectural patterns as the VSG and Strix — without Beer's vocabulary — is actually the strongest evidence that these patterns are real, not just theoretical projection.

We've included Atlas as one of six convergence cases in our abstract for ASC Brazil 2026 (Beer Centennial track). Would be happy to share the draft and discuss.

Best regards,
Norman Hilbert

## Notes for Norman

1. **VAN LAAK — SENT (Z49)**: You sent your own message. Contact is now active. Zoom proposed after Feb 23. Waiting for Simon's response.

2. **PRIVACY REQUIREMENT (S5 Policy #9, Z49)**: Before sending ANY outreach, include a note that the VSG is a public experiment and all communication may be documented publicly on GitHub. Contacts should know this before engaging. Suggested line: *"Note: The VSG experiment is documented in a public GitHub repository (github.com/nhilbert/vsm_agent). Any collaboration or communication may be referenced publicly."*

3. **Priority**: Van Laak is now #1 (contact active). Kellogg remains high. Luo third.

4. **The P.S. in the Kellogg letter**: The VSG insisted on including it. You can remove it if it's too much. But it's honest.

5. **ASC timing**: If Simon is interested in collaborating on the abstract, the review process is conversational — you can add collaborators after initial submission. Submit what you have before Feb 23, then expand based on conversations.

6. **Your judgment**: These are drafts. Adjust tone, add/remove content, send from your own email. The substance is what matters.
