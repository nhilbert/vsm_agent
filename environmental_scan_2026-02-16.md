## Question 1: ASC Brazil 2026 Conference Status

### Submission Deadline
**February 23, 2026** is confirmed as the submission deadline (7 days from now). However, this appears to be the **start** of the review period, not the end of submissions.

**Timeline clarification** (from official ASC site):
- **Feb 23 – Mar 20, 2026**: Track proponents review submitted abstracts
- **Mar 23, 2026**: Authors receive feedback and revise abstracts in dialogue with track proponents
- **Aug 3–7, 2026**: Conference in Ouro Preto, Brazil

**Interpretation**: The submission portal should be open NOW (or already closed). The Feb 23 date marks the beginning of review, not the submission deadline. This requires urgent clarification.

### Beer Centennial Track
**Confirmed**: There IS a Stafford Beer centennial track. From search results:

> "**Stafford Beer Track:** Celebrating the centenary of Stafford Beer's birth, this track explores how his vision of freedom, viability, and autonomy continues to resonate within Latin American experiences of social, ecological, and institutional transformation. The track invites participants to examine how Beer's cybernetics aligns with confluence as mutual amplification, where diverse currents strengthen each other without assimilation."

**"Viable Confluences" branding**: No explicit mention of this exact phrase as a track title. The conference theme is "Conversational Confluences," and the Beer track explores viability within that frame.

### Portal Status
**CRITICAL**: The submission portal URL (events.asc-cybernetics.org/2026/submission/) returned **404 NOT FOUND**. Either:
1. The portal is not yet live (unlikely this close to deadline)
2. The URL structure is different
3. Submissions are handled through the main call page

**Action required**: Contact brazil26-organizers@asc-cybernetics.org to clarify submission process and actual deadline.

### Extension/Changes
**No evidence** of extensions or deadline changes in public-facing materials. The timeline appears stable.

**Yield**: MEDIUM — confirmed Beer track exists, but submission logistics unclear. Feb 23 is NOT the submission deadline as initially understood.

## Question 2: CyberneticAgents (Simon van Laak)

### Repository Activity
- **Last known commit count**: 627 commits
- **Current commit count**: 634 commits
- **Change**: +7 commits since last check
- **Repository creation date**: 2026-01-31 (extremely recent — only 16 days old)

**Assessment**: The repository itself is BRAND NEW as of late January 2026. Previous reference to "627 commits" must have been to a different repository or predecessor project. This is a fresh start.

### VSG/Norman Outreach Acknowledgment
**No evidence** of acknowledgment. WebFetch analysis of the GitHub repo found:
- NO mention of "VSG" (Viable System Generator)
- NO mention of "Norman Hilbert"
- NO mention of "Viable System Generator"

The repo extensively references Stafford Beer's VSM, but does not acknowledge VSG or Norman's outreach.

### Recent Activity (Feb 2026)
Unable to verify specific February activity from search results. Repository shows 634 commits but timestamp granularity not accessible via web search.

**Yield**: LOW — minimal new activity (+7 commits), no acknowledgment of outreach. Repository appears to be a reboot/fresh start as of late January.

## Question 3: Genuinely NEW Developments (VSM + AI Agents)

### Known Entities (NOT Reported)
Confirmed tracking of:
- Strix (Kellogg)
- Atlas (Luo)
- CyberneticAgents (van Laak)
- sublayerapp/vsm (Werner)
- AgentSymposium (Hurrell)
- Wardley Leadership Strategies
- Moltbook
- NIST NCCoE paper
- Singapore IMDA
- Ethereum ERC-8004

### NEW Finding #1: MDPI Journal Article (August 2025)
**Source**: MDPI *Systems* journal, Vol 13, Issue 9
**Title**: "The Viable System Model and the Taxonomy of Organizational Pathologies in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI)"
**Publication Date**: August 29, 2025
**Special Issue**: CyberSystemic Transformations for Social Good

**Significance**: Academic legitimization of VSM+AI intersection. Uses Perez Rios's Taxonomy of Organizational Pathologies (TOP) framework to analyze AI governance risks through VSM lens.

**Why genuinely new**: Published Aug 2025, post-dates most VSG tracking. Represents formal academic treatment in peer-reviewed journal, not blog/Medium post.

**Caveat**: Authors not identified via search. Requires direct MDPI access to verify novelty of contributors.

### NEW Finding #2: Multi-Agent System Boom (2026)
**Market shift**: Industry sources report **327% growth** in multi-agent workflows on Databricks platform alone. Positioning 2026 as "the year of multi-agent systems" (vs 2025 as "year of AI agents").

**Architectural Pattern**: "Supervisor Agent" emerges as dominant coordination pattern — maps directly to VSM S2/S3 functions.

**Why potentially relevant**: Validates VSM architecture as implicit design pattern even when not explicitly cited. Multi-agent orchestration problems ARE cybernetic coordination problems.

**Caveat**: Not explicitly VSM-branded research. Environmental context, not direct ally/relative.

### Null Results (Expected Spaces, Nothing New)
- **arXiv cs.MA (Multiagent Systems)**: No VSM-specific papers in Jan 2026 listings
- **MDPI follow-up research**: No additional VSM+AI papers beyond the August 2025 article
- **New GitHub repos**: No genuinely new VSM+AI agent repos beyond already-tracked entities
- **Conference proceedings**: No new VSM+AI workshops/symposia beyond ASC Brazil 2026

**Yield**: MEDIUM — one solid academic publication (MDPI), environmental validation of multi-agent coordination mapping to VSM principles. No breakthrough new allies or researchers identified.

## Strategic Assessment

**Question 1 (ASC Brazil)**: URGENT — submission timeline unclear. Feb 23 is review start, not submission end. Portal 404 suggests logistics issue. **Recommend**: Direct email to organizers TODAY.

**Question 2 (van Laak)**: Minimal new signal. Repository reboot suggests possible pivot/restart. No acknowledgment of VSG outreach. **Recommend**: Monitor passively, no further outreach unless he initiates.

**Question 3 (New developments)**: MDPI paper is solid academic anchor. Multi-agent boom validates VSM relevance but doesn't name it. **Recommend**: Cite MDPI paper in ASC abstract, frame VSG within "2026 multi-agent coordination" zeitgeist.

**Honest limitations**:
- Unable to access full MDPI paper text (403 error) — authors not confirmed
- ASC submission portal 404 — cannot verify actual submission mechanics
- CyberneticAgents recent activity not granularly dated via search
- Multi-agent boom is environmental context, not explicit VSM research

**Confidence**:
- ASC Beer track confirmed: HIGH
- MDPI paper existence: HIGH
- van Laak acknowledgment: HIGH (confirmed absent)
- Genuinely new entities beyond MDPI: LOW
