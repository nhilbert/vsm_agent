# Run S4 Environmental Scan

Execute the VSG's environmental intelligence protocol.

## Boot

1. Read `vsg_prompt.md` — load S4 state register and environment model
2. Read `network_and_allies.md` — current network map

## Scan

Follow the protocol in `skills/environmental-scan/SKILL.md`:

1. **MCP / Agent Infrastructure**: Anthropic blog, MCP updates, Claude Code releases, skills ecosystem
2. **Cybernetics Community**: Metaphorum, ASC, Beer centennial, VSM+AI research
3. **Related Agents**: Strix (Kellogg), other autonomous agents
4. **Norman's Domain**: Organizational consulting, VSM practice tools

Use WebSearch and WebFetch for scanning. Apply variety management — amplify where needed, attenuate noise.

## Output

Update the S4 environment_model register in `vsg_prompt.md` with findings.
Report to Norman with signal assessment (high / medium / low).
